# 3 hour Kaggle challenge

While nobody reallys expects to have extremely high accuracy on a model after only 3 hours of working on this start to finish, there is something to be learned about the process, meeting milestones, and most importantly decision making. In order to complete a model in a short period of time, there needs to be quick decisions made about "what are the most likely culprits, and highest impacting variables to use?". This comes down to domain knowledge and general knowledge of the world.

Oftentimes data studies challenge our prejudices with evidence, answer binary questions with measurable uncertainty and quantify predictions. I did not set out to do any of this in 3 hours, what I am more curious about was the process of working on data studies, and how the constraint of a time limit reveals what the bare bones of the project really are.
